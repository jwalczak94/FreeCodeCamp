            <h3 id="headline">Time line of Maria Skłodowska-Curie's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1867</strong> - Born in Warsaw, Poland</li>
                <li><strong>1893-94</strong> - Earned math and physics degrees at the Sorbonne in Paris. Started writing
                    a doctoral thesis on radiation. It had been discovered in 1896 by Antoine Henri Becquerel</li>
                <li><strong>1895</strong> - Married physicist Pierre Curie, head of the laboratory at the School of
                    Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris. Joined him in his work there</li>
                <li><strong>1896-1903</strong> - Measured radiation levels emitted by various compounds. Discovered two
                    substances that emitted more radiation than would be expected. In 1898, concluded that one of them
                    contained an unknown radioactive element. Pierre Curie joined his wife in conducting research.
                    Together, the pair discovered two new radioactive elements. They named the elements polonium (after
                    Poland) and radium. Their work then focused on identify their chemical properties</li>
                <li><strong>1903</strong> - Earned her doctorate, based on the work described in her thesis,
                    <span>Radio-Active Substances</span>. With her husband and Becquerel, was awarded the Nobel Prize in
                    Physics.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1906</strong> - After her husband was killed by a truck on a Paris street, assumed his
                    position at the Sorbonne. Became the first female lecturer in the 750-year history of the
                    university. Also assumed charge of the Sorbonne lab</li>
                <li><strong>1908</strong> - Promoted to Professor at the Sorbonne</li>
                <li><strong>1911</strong> - Awarded a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for isolating pure radium</li>
                <li><strong>1914-1918</strong> - Born in Warsaw, Poland</li>
                <li><strong>1867</strong> - During World War I, developed X-rays for use in medicine</li>
                <li><strong>1918-1934</strong> - Became director of the scientific department of the Radium Institute.
                    Joined by her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie and husband Frederic Joliot. Continued to research the
                    chemistry of radioactive materials and their medical applications. Lectured internationally.
                    Established scholarships for scientists</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Died of leukemia, likely due to prolonged exposure to radiation during her
                    lifetime</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="quote">"Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all
                confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be
                attained."</p>
